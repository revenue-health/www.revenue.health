## How do you work with EHRs and EMRs?

Our EMR Training curriculum is customized to each client, with individual workflows defining a personalized approach.  We have a unique approach, catering to individual user groups, ensuring a better learning experience. Our training experts can staff or supplement all of your training needs.

## How do you keep us compliant?

The healthcare landscape is constantly evolving with new rules and regulations that are fundamentally changing the way physicians work and practice. The world of coding is just one of these frequent changes that occur on a regular basis. From ICD-9 to ICD-10 to RAC Audits to new modifiers, it is a challenge to keep pace with the new rules and coding practices.

Revenue Health has a team of certified coders that help physicians in 50+ specialties to not only code correctly but also look for opportunities where physicians may be under-coding. We can provide both proactive and retroactive coding audits to ensure that practices remain compliant with coding guidelines. In the daily life of a practice, it’s easy to repeat broken processes or mistype information due to the fast-pace environment.

CMS recommends that providers seek external reviews to help ensure that practices remain compliant in order to avoid potential fines and hours of time with paperwork. Revenue Health’s team has kept many practices compliant, saving them hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines. In addition, we’ve helped prepare organizations with proper self-reporting when experiencing an OIG audit.

What Revenue Health Delivers:

* Proactive claim and document reviews identify coding and modifier errors
* Expert coders help you avoid legal and financial exposure
* Unbiased reviews prepare you for OIG and RAC audits
* Comprehensive analysis of your contracts, claims, and payments to find potential underpayments
* Allows your staff to focus on patients while receiving additional training and education from our experts

## Can you help us with PQRS and Meaningful Use?

Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) is a healthcare quality improvement incentive program initiated by CMS. At Revenue Health, we aggregate, analyze, and electronically submit qualifying data to CMS thus avoiding penalties and gaining incentives on the physician practices.

Revenue Health’s Meaningful Use reporting provides the necessary data points and knowledge needed to assist our clients to intelligently manage their day-to-day operations, efficiently manage their communication protocols and more importantly to achieve consistent / predictable collection numbers. Our solutions ensure a comprehensive and relevant summary of key metrics designed to improve administrative, operational and financial performance. Its capabilities enhance the insight across the organization – from insurance calling agents to the executives – to more effectively manage their collection trends, determine actionable insights and analyze data in a more meaningful way. We believe our dashboards will assist the end users to manage their respective functional areas of the business more effectively.
