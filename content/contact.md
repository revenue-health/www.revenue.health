Revenue Health is a complete Healthcare Solutions company specializing in revenue cycle management. We put latest technology to work ensuring high performance standards with breach-proof security. Revenue Health was formed out of the desire to create a Billing and Practice Management Company with a poise to deliver quality services.

We provide full-service RCM and Billing services for:

* **Independent physicians and medical practices**. Government regulations, changes in reimbursement, increasing costs, and technology adoption are making it harder than ever for physicians to remain independent. Instead of joining a larger practice or health system, let us help you keep and maintain your indepenence.
* **Home and other post-acute care agencies**. The future of healthcare is in the home but reimbursement pressures from commercial and government insurance remains intense. We get you paid faster based on your existing contracts with different insurance companies and RAP claims to get payments in advance.
* **Hospitals and health systems**. As hospitals and health systems make the switch to alternative payment models and new value-based care agreements such as DSRIP, ACOs and PCMHs, they need proven solutions and trusted partners who support their goals.
