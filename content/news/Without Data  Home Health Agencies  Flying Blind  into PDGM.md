For home health agencies wondering how they’ll fare under the upcoming Patient-Driven Groupings Model (PDGM), data is likely the closest thing they’ll find to a crystal ball.Data can help agencies determine where they stand under the revolutionary new reimbursement model and — in many cases — even guide them to operate more efficiently come PDGM’s 2020 implementation.On the most basic level, data can help paint a portrait of an agency’s patient population, including its clinical and referral makeup. Both factors will become increasingly important under PDGM, in which reimbursements will be driven largely by patient characteristics rather than visit volume.In other words: Certain factors — such as admission source and diagnoses — will mean more money for agencies. For example, wound care will be associated with higher reimbursement, as it requires more home health resources than many other ailments. Therapy, on the other hand, will no longer mean a hefty payday for providers.<br><br><a href="https://homehealthcarenews.com/2019/08/without-data-home-health-agencies-flying-blind-into-pdgm/">Read on homehealthcarenews.com</a>
